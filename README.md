### ‚ú® Support us!

#### 1. Translation

We need your help! We are currently using Google Translate to translate our [language data](https://github.com/The-AniLab/AniLab-Discord-Bot/tree/master/languages). If you found that the our translation is incorrect, compare with the original `en-us.json`, please help us to fix by creating a pull request. 

Also, if you want to add more language, please **copy** exactly what we wrote in `en-us.json`, and translate. You can see our demonstration below:

```json
"LANGUAGE":
{
    "title": "please_translate_here",
    "description": "please_translate_here"
},
```

`please_translate_here` is the place where you can translate.

#### 2. Add new languages

If you want to add more languages, we would glad to see your translation. For adding new language, please follow these steps below:

**a. Open [language.cpp](https://github.com/The-AniLab/AniLab-Discord-Bot/blob/master/src/cmd_common/language.cpp) and copy and paste like this:**

```cpp
else if (language == "japanese")
{
    if (check_user)
        database.deleteRecord("configuration", "id=" + target_user);

    change_language = "ja-jp";
    database.insert("configuration", target_user + ", '" + change_language + "'");
}
// Copy from here ...
else if (language == "{change_here}")
{
    if (check_user)
        database.deleteRecord("configuration", "id=" + target_user);

    change_language = "{change_here}";
    database.insert("configuration", target_user + ", '" + change_language + "'");
}
// ... to here, and paste like a "chain" else-if statement
```

`{change_here}` variable is the variable you **should** change when you added.

**b. Create your `.json` file in our [language data](https://github.com/The-AniLab/AniLab-Discord-Bot/tree/master/languages)**

Please make sure to name the file like this:

```
{Language}-{regional}.json
```

For example: `en-uk.json`: Language is English, regional is United Kingdom

**c. Go to [cores/cmd_layout.h](https://github.com/The-AniLab/AniLab-Discord-Bot/blob/master/cores/cmd_layout.h) and do like this:**

```cpp
inline std::map<std::string, Command> commands
{ 
    // Common commands
    {
        "ping",
        {
            "Check bot latency", ping 
        }
    },
    {
        "language",
        {
            "Configure bot language to show to you", language,
            {
                dpp::command_option(dpp::co_string, "option", "Your language option", true)
                    .add_choice(dpp::command_option_choice("English", std::string("english")))
                    // Copy this line below and change where you found {change_here} ...
                    .add_choice(dpp::command_option_choice("{change_here}", std::string("{change_here}")))
                    // ... end of your copy
            }
        }
    },
};
```

`{change_here}` is the variable you should change like what we did above.

Thank you so much for collaborating ^^
